## History

The project began with the creation of a frontend designed to complement the Python backend, inspired by its UI mockups, available at https://github.com/PythBuster/savings_manager. This backend has also been preserved at https://github.com/Jasmin68k/savings-manager-backend.

To fully implement all features initially envisioned by the original backend's author, the backend was first reimplemented, then extended upon using NodeJS/Express (see above). This included the completion of all proposed features. The frontend was developed concurrently to ensure seamless integration with the new NodeJS/Express backend, thus meeting the initial project specifications.

A version of this frontend which is not feature-complete yet remains fully API-compatible with the original Python backend is available in the `compatibility/python-backend` branch. The feature-complete version of the project is available in the `master` branch.
